# VGPT2 v3 Training Master Plan

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Status:** 🔴 PAUSED - Approach Under Review
**Author:** Training Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

We have completed TWO DPO training runs that both failed to achieve the desired hallucination reduction. This document captures what we have, what went wrong, and the plan to fix it properly.

### Current State

| Stage | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| SFT (Stage 1) | ✅ Complete | 67,448 examples trained, 15.9 hrs |
| DPO v1 (Stage 2) | ❌ Failed | 1,427 pairs, 57% hallucination score |
| DPO v2 (Stage 2) | ❌ Failed | 2,584 pairs, 57% hallucination, **caused over-rejection** |

### Critical Finding

**DPO v2 trained the model to reject REAL Vista tables as non-existent.**

```
Q: "Describe the APTL table structure"
A: "The table 'APTL' does not exist in Viewpoint Vista..."
```
APTL IS A REAL TABLE. The model learned rejection TOO WELL.

## Hardware Configuration

| Component | Spec | Current Usage |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| GPU | RTX A6000 (48GB VRAM) | ⚠️ Under-utilized |
| CPU | Threadripper 7960X (24c/48t) | ⚠️ Under-utilized |
| RAM | 128GB DDR5 | ✅ Adequate |

### Training Config Issues Found

```yaml
# CURRENT (suboptimal)
per_device_train_batch_size: 1      # Too conservative
gradient_accumulation_steps: 16     # Compensates but slow
dataloader_num_workers: 0           # NO parallel loading!

# RECOMMENDED
per_device_train_batch_size: 2-4    # A6000 can handle more
gradient_accumulation_steps: 8      # Adjust for effective batch
dataloader_num_workers: 8           # Use CPU threads!
```

## What We Have

### Training Data

| File | Records | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| `vgpt2_v3_sft.json` | 67,448 | SFT training | ✅ Used |
| `vgpt2_v3_dpo.json` | 1,427 | Original DPO (90% NOLOCK) | ⚠️ Imbalanced |
| `vgpt2_v3_dpo_v2.json` | 2,584 | Halluc DPO (83% rejection) | ❌ Caused over-rejection |
| `vgpt2_v3_kto.json` | ? | KTO data | ⏸️ Not used yet |

### Trained Models

| Path | Stage | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `saves/vgpt2_v3/sft/` | Stage 1 | ✅ Good baseline |
| `saves/vgpt2_v3/dpo/` | Stage 2 v1 | 57% hallucination |
| `saves/vgpt2_v3/dpo_v2/` | Stage 2 v2 | ❌ Over-rejects real tables |

### Validation Results (DPO v2)

| Category | Score | Issue |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Join | 98% | ✅ Excellent |
| SQL Generation | 87% | ✅ Good |
| Schema | 86% | ⚠️ Degraded from SFT |
| Error Correction | 83% | ✅ Good |
| Business Logic | 80% | ✅ Good |
| Hallucination | 57% | 🔴 Failed + over-rejects |

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Imbalanced DPO Data

| Dataset | Halluc Rejection | Other | Result |
|---------|------------------|-------|--------|
| DPO v1 | 5% | 95% | Ignored hallucination signal |
| DPO v2 | 83% | 17% | Over-learned rejection |

### Problem 2: Missing Positive Reinforcement

We only taught "fake tables don't exist" but NEVER taught "real tables DO exist":

```json
// WE HAD (rejection only)
{"instruction": "Query Invoice table", "chosen": "doesn't exist", "rejected": "SELECT..."}

// WE NEEDED (also positive)
{"instruction": "Describe APTL", "chosen": "APTL is AP Transaction Lines...", "rejected": "doesn't exist"}
```

### Problem 3: Test Suite Keyword Mismatch

Model says: "There is **no table or view** named 'Invoice'"
Test expects: "**doesn't exist**" or "**not exist**"

The model behavior may be correct, but the test keywords don't match.

---

### New DPO v3 Dataset Requirements

| Category | Count | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Fake table rejection | 800 | "Invoice doesn't exist, use APTH" |
| **Real table acceptance** | 800 | "APTL exists, here's its structure" |
| Fake column rejection | 400 | "CustomerName doesn't exist in ARCM" |
| NOLOCK preferences | 300 | Style correction |
| JOIN quality | 200 | Multi-column JOIN patterns |
| **TOTAL** | 2,500 | Balanced 50/50 reject/accept |

### Key Principle: For Every Rejection, Add an Acceptance

```json
// Rejection pair
{"instruction": "Query Invoice", "chosen": "doesn't exist, use APTH", "rejected": "SELECT * FROM Invoice"}

// Matching acceptance pair
{"instruction": "Describe APTH", "chosen": "APTH is AP Transaction Header...", "rejected": "doesn't exist"}
```

---

## Validation Plan (Before ANY Training)

### Step 1: Ground Truth Baseline

Have Claude answer all 47 test questions to establish what "correct" looks like.

### Step 2: Targeted Probe Test

Before training, test the SFT model with diagnostic questions:
```
"Does APTL exist in Vista?" → Must say YES
"Does Invoice exist in Vista?" → Must say NO
"Does APTH exist in Vista?" → Must say YES
"Does Customer exist in Vista?" → Must say NO
```

### Step 3: Training Data Audit

Review the new DPO dataset to verify:
- [ ] Real tables are NEVER in rejection pairs
- [ ] Fake tables are NEVER in acceptance pairs
- [ ] 50/50 balance between rejection and acceptance
- [ ] Test keywords match expected model responses

### Step 4: Held-Out Validation Set

Create 50+ hallucination test cases NOT in training data:
- Edge cases: `AP_TH`, `apth`, `APTransactionHeader`
- Near-misses: `APHD` (doesn't exist), `APTH` (exists)
- Module confusion: "Get AR invoices" (no AR invoices table)

## Success Criteria for DPO v3

| Metric | Current (DPO v2) | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Overall | 80% | >85% |
| Hallucination | 57% | >85% |
| Schema | 86% | >90% |
| No false rejections | ❌ Has them | ✅ Zero |

---

## Decision Points

1. **Should we try DPO at all?** Or focus on better SFT data?
2. **Is 50/50 the right balance?** Or should acceptance be higher?
3. **Should we use KTO instead?** Binary feedback may be simpler.
4. **Is the test suite correct?** Need to validate expectations.
