# Output Artifacts (V4)

Expected files after validation:
- `probe_sft.json` (or `probe_sft_rerun.json`): probe results against SFT checkpoint.
- Evaluation reports (e.g., complex test metrics) if generated.

Keep V4 outputs separate from legacy results. Old reports can be moved to `archive/` once V4 is validated.
